    <h3> Future Possibilities </h3>
    <p> 1-We aim to enhance the accuracy of carbon emission calculations by introducing the option for users to specify the type of car they are driving. We recognize that vehicles equipped with different engine types, makes, and models can vary significantly in their carbon emission profiles. By allowing users to input this specific information, we can tailor our calculations to better reflect the emissions associated with their individual vehicles. This approach will enable us to provide more personalized and precise assessments of carbon footprints, empowering users with valuable insights into the environmental impact of their transportation choices.  <br> <br> <br> <br> 2- Additionally, we intend to introduce an option for users to specify the type of fuel their vehicle is running on, thereby enabling more precise calculations of carbon emissions. We acknowledge that the composition of fuels varies widely, leading to significant differences in their carbon emission profiles. This feature will offer users a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of their transportation choices, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their sustainability goals.</p>
