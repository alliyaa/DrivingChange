    <h3 class="section-heading">Assumptions</h3>
    <p class="section-content">
        It is acknowledged that various vehicle models emit differing amounts of carbon based on their make, model, and fuel efficiency. To maintain simplicity and generalizability in our calculations, we have opted to utilize data derived from average vehicle emissions based in the United States. In the absence of comprehensive research on public transport vehicles' emissions in Saudi Arabia, we have relied on data sourced from the United States for our analysis. Given the similarities in vehicle technology, fuel composition, and operating conditions between the two regions, we are assuming that the emission patterns observed in the United States will be reasonably representative of those in Saudi Arabia. While this assumption allows us to make informed estimates, it is essential to acknowledge the potential differences between the two contexts that may affect emission outcomes. As such, our findings should be interpreted with caution, and further localized research in Saudi Arabia is warranted to validate and refine our assumptions.

    <h3 class="section-heading">Limitations</h3>
    <p class="section-content">
        One notable limitation of our project is the carbon emissions generated during idling periods, particularly in congested traffic conditions. While our calculations accurately capture emissions during vehicle movement, they do not account for the carbon emitted when a vehicle is stationary but the engine is running. Idling represents a significant source of emissions, especially in urban areas where traffic congestion is common. By not incorporating this aspect into our analysis, our estimates may underestimate the true environmental impact of driving in densely populated areas or during peak traffic times. Future iterations of our project could explore methods to integrate idling emissions data, thereby providing a more comprehensive assessment of carbon footprints associated with vehicular travel.
